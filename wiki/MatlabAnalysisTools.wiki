#summary Analysis tools in Matlab


= PCA =

`performPCA` perform PCA on a result.txt

== Direction ==

In MATLAB -- for a given results.txt file, e.g. at (Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo/result.txt) that has been generated by ca_script in a project, do this to run PCA and visualize:

-   RUN MATLAB
-   Change the path to `/Applications/Programming/softwarestudies/matlab/analysis`
     (this is standard for software studies script kit install)
-   Run the command

{{{
[data, headers, filesnames] = readResultFile('/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo/result.txt');
}}}

-   Run the command

{{{
performPCA(data,filesnames,'/Users/username/Desktop/script_demo/movie_demo',100)
}}}


= ShotAnalyzer =

`shotAnalyzer` computes per-shot averages from a result.txt


= Summarizer =

`summarizer` computes averages of each column from a result.txt
