== CAscript ==

=== Using CAscript ===

CAscript is the master script for running many feature extraction tools on a set of images or a movie. 

CAscript is called by using comamnd *`cascript`*.

{{{
USAGE: cascript [OPTIONS] <project directory>
OPTIONS
	-h,--help    	Show this usage screen.
	   --url     	Download and create project directory from URL.
	   --video   	Force video mode.
	   --sampling	Set sampling rate when we sample frames as previews
	-v           	Verbose mode.
}}}
  
*`<project directory>`* is assumed to have a subdirectory called *`source`* which contains the original data. The original data can be either a movie file or a set of images. In addition, *`cascript`* can instead download a movie file directly from the internet and run analysis on it.

==== Notes about options ====
 * `--video`: This is useful when your source file is not a movie but a sequence of images. In order to tell *`cascript`* to include video analysid i.e. shot-detection, `--video` is required.
 * `-v`: *`cascript`* is primarily developed to run in batch mode. So, by default, there is very little information being printed on screen. If `-v` is used, then *`cascript`* will print more information on screen.


==== Examples ====

 # Movie from existing file
  * Create a project directory called *`test`*.
  * Create a subdirectory under *`test`* called *`source`*
  * Copy the movie file into *`source`*
  * Run *`cascript test`*
 # Movie from `http://www.test.com/test.avi`
  * Run *`cascript --url http://www.test.com/test.avi test`*. In this case, the script will automatically create project directory called *`test`*.
 # Images
  * Create a project directory called *`test`*.
  * Create a subdirectory under *`test`* called *`source`*
  * Copy the images file into *`source`*
  * Run *`cascript test`*


=== Default parameters for CAscript ===

{{{
samplingRate = 10

default_ffmpeg_args = '-t 300 -sameq'
default_line_args = '--preset high'
default_shot_args = ''
default_color_args = '-q 2'

supportedMovieType = ['mpeg','mpg','avi','mov','m4v','mp4']
supportedImageType = ['jpg','jpeg','png','tif','tiff','bmp']
}}}


== CAbatch ==

=== Using CAbatch ===

CAbatch is a batch wrapper that takes a list of movie file URLs and runs CAscript on each movie file in a separate subdirectory.

CAbatch is called by using command *`cabatch`*.

{{{
USAGE: cabatch <configuration file>
}}}
  
*`<configuration file>`* is a tab-delimited text file with two entries per line. The first entry is a full URL, the second entry is a text string to be used as the subdirectory name where the downloaded file will be processed by cascript.

==== Example Configuration File ====

{{{
http://my.url.com/movie1.mp4	1_Intro
http://my.url.com/movie2.mp4	2_Main
http://my.url.com/movie3.mp4	3_Conclusion
}}}

==== Examples ====

 # Movie list from websites
  * Create a batch project directory called *`batch_test`*.
  * Create a configuration file under * `batch_test`* called *`cabatch.cfg`*
  * Add two URLs and directory titles to *`cabatch.cfg`* as per the example configuration file above
  * Run *`cabatch cabatch.cfg`*
 # Movie list from drive
  * To be supported
