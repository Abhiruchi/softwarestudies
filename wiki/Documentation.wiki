=== Using CAscript ===

CAscript is the master script for running many feature extraction tools on a set of images or a movie. 

CAscript is called by using comamnd *`cascript`*.

{{{
USAGE: cascript [OPTIONS] <project directory>
OPTIONS
	-h,--help    	Show this usage screen.
	   --url     	Download and create project directory from URL.
	   --video   	Force video mode.
	   --sampling	Set sampling rate when we sample frames as previews
	-v           	Verbose mode.
}}}
  
*`<project directory>`* is assumed to have a subdirectory called *`source`* which contains the original data. The original data can be either a movie file or a set of images. In addition, *`cascript`* can instead download a movie file directly from the internet and run analysis on it.

==== Notes about options ====
 * `--video`: This is useful when your source file is not a movie but a sequence of images. In order to tell *`cascript`* to include video analysid i.e. shot-detection, `--video` is required.
 * `-v`: *`cascript`* is primarily developed to run in batch mode. So, by default, there is very little information being printed on screen. If `-v` is used, then *`cascript`* will print more information on screen.


==== Examples ====

 # Movie from existing file
  * Create a project directory called *`test`*.
  * Create a subdirectory under *`test`* called *`source`*
  * Copy the movie file into *`source`*
  * Run *`cascript test`*
 # Movie from `http://www.test.com/test.avi`
  * Run *`cascript --url http://www.test.com/test.avi test`*. In this case, the script will automatically create project directory called *`test`*.
 # Images
  * Create a project directory called *`test`*.
  * Create a subdirectory under *`test`* called *`source`*
  * Copy the images file into *`source`*
  * Run *`cascript test`*
