#summary Documentation for FeatureExtractor


{{{
FEATUREEXTRACTOR Extract visual features from jpeg files.
 
    Input: 
       input_location - path to images or a file containing paths to images.
       prefix - prefix of the output files.
       options - can be any of the following:
         '-r' Also process files in sub-directories
 
   Important Notes:
    1. Input files must have .jpg extension.
    2. Type of an image (RGB or grayscale) is determined by using jpeg 
    header. As a result, if a grayscale image is saved as an RGB image,
    FeatureExtractor will assume that the image is an RGB image.
    3. A log file named "prefix_log.txt" is generated automatically

== Features ==

=== Adaptive color quantization features ===
{{{ 
f_adaptiveColorQ Adaptive color quantization
 
    Input: I = RGB image
           n = number of different colors to reduce to
           k = number of colors to report
    Remarks: 
      1. When number of colors on the image is less than k, NaN is used
         to indicate extra colors.
      2. RGB has range [0,255]. HSV has range [0,1].

=== Basic Light features ===
{{{
  f_basicLight Basic statistics from a grayscale image.
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
}}}


=== Basic RGB features ===
{{{
  f_basicRGB Basic statistics from RGB channel
 
    Input: I - RGB image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
}}}


=== Basic HSV features ===
{{{
  f_basicHSV Basic statistics from HSV channel
 
    Input: I - HSV image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
