#summary Documentation for FeatureExtractor

= How to run =
== Option 1: Use the wrapper scripts ==

Simple mode:
{{{
./runFeatureExtractor.sh {path-to-images-or-image-list} {prefix}
}}}

Or, also process sub-directories:
{{{
./runFeatureExtractor_subdirs.sh {path-to-images-or-image-list} {prefix}
}}}

== Option 2: Run from matlab interactively ==

  # Start matlab without GUI
{{{
matlab -nodisplay
}}}
  # In matlab, set script path
{{{
path(path,'PUT-YOUR-SCRIPT-PATH-HERE');
}}}
  # Run FeatureExtractor
{{{
FeatureExtractor('PATH-TO-IMAGES-OR-IMAGE-LIST','PREFIX');
}}}
  # Exit matlab
{{{
exit;
}}}

= More about FeatureExtractor =
{{{
FEATUREEXTRACTOR Extract visual features from jpeg files.
 
    Input: 
       input_location - path to images or a file containing paths to images.
       prefix - prefix of the output files.
       options - can be any of the following:
         '-r' Also process files in sub-directories
 
   Important Notes:
    1. Input files must have .jpg extension.
    2. Type of an image (RGB or grayscale) is determined by using jpeg 
    header. As a result, if a grayscale image is saved as an RGB image,
    FeatureExtractor will assume that the image is an RGB image.
    3. A log file named "prefix_log.txt" is generated automatically

= Features =

=== Adaptive color quantization features ===
{{{ 
f_adaptiveColorQ Adaptive color quantization
 
    Input: I = RGB image
           n = number of different colors to reduce to
           k = number of colors to report
    Remarks: 
      1. When number of colors on the image is less than k, NaN is used
         to indicate extra colors.
      2. RGB has range [0,255]. HSV has range [0,1]. 
}}}

=== Basic Color features ===
{{{
  f_basicLight Basic statistics from a grayscale image.
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
}}}

{{{
  f_basicRGB Basic statistics from RGB channel
 
    Input: I - RGB image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
}}}

{{{
  f_basicHSV Basic statistics from HSV channel
 
    Input: I - HSV image
    Remarks: 
      1. Skewness and kurtosis can be NaN.
}}}

=== BDIP and BVLC ===
{{{
  f_bdip Block difference of inverse probabilities.
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
           n - number of spatial blocks
           d - distance to calculate correlation
    Remarks:
      1. Ordering of spatial features is assigned left-to-right e.g.
                 1 | 2
                -------
                 3 | 4 
      2. The feature values has range from 0 to 1 where 0 corresponds to
      no texture.
}}}

{{{
  f_bvlc Block variabtion of local correlation coefficients.
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
           n - number of spatial blocks
           d - distance to calculate correlation
    Remarks:
      1. Ordering of spatial features is assigned left-to-right e.g.
                 1 | 2
                -------
                 3 | 4 
      2. Higher BVLC indicates higher degree of roughness.
}}}

=== Color Histograms ===
{{{
  f_grayHist n-bin grayscale histogram
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
           n - number of bins
    Remarks: 
      1. The output histogram is normalized so that the bin with maximum
      frequency always has value of 1.0
}}}

{{{
  f_rgbHist n-bin RGB histogram
 
    Input: I - RGB image
           n - number of bins
    Remarks:
      1. The output histogram is normalized so that the bin with maximum
      frequency always has value of 1.0. The normalization is done across 
      colors i.e. [RH GH BH]/max([RH GH BH])
}}}

{{{
  f_hsvHist n-bin HSV histogram
 
    Input: I - HSV image
           n - number of bins
    Remarks:
      1. The output histogram is normalized so that the bin with maximum
      frequency always has value of 1.0. The normalization is done across 
      colors i.e. [HH SH VH]/max([HH SH VH])
}}}

=== Gabor features ===
{{{
  f_gabor Gabor features
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
    Remarks:
      1. When the image is too small for the filter size, NaN is returned
      instead.
}}}

=== Texture features ===
{{{
  f_entropy Entropy
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
}}}

{{{
  f_sobel Average energy of sobel filter per pixel
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
}}}

{{{
  f_glcm GLCM information
 
    Input: I - grayscale image
           D - distance for GLCM
}}}

=== Color segmentation features ===
{{{
  f_segment Partition image into segments of similar colors.
 
    Input: I - RGB or grayscale image
    Remarks:
      1. Ordering of spatial features is assigned left-to-right e.g.
                 1 | 2
                -------
                 3 | 4 
      2. When the input image is grayscale, the intensity histogram is
      enhanced by adaptive histogram equalization technique. Also, the
      edges are thickened by erosion.
